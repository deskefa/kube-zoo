# Kube Zoo
A mixed zoo of data tools and engines running on kubernetes

## **Warning**, this is very incomplete and experimental

The main objective is to **explore** the setup of environments for local development and production deployment of an **open-source analitical stack running on Kubernetes** and composed of:
- [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/)
- [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/)
- [Druid](druid.io/)
- [Apache Kudo](https://kudu.apache.org/)

Plus some UI utilities:
- [Superset](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset)
- [Metabase](https://metabase.com)
- [Pivot/Imply UI](https://imply.io) or [Swiv](https://github.com/yahoo/swiv)
- [Apache Zeppelin](https://zeppelin.apache.org)
